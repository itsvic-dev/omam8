; this example demonstrates both bank switching support
; and behaviour on reading invalid banks.
; the assembler doesn't support assembling multiple banks yet

mov 2, %a
poke [0xC000], %a
peek [0xC000], %b
; if the value of B is 2, the bank switch was incorrect and a write to ROM was incorrectly emulated
; if the value of B is 0xFF, the bank switch was correct and an invalid bank was correctly emulated
